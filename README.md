Data Availability statement:

The source code of our experiment can not be recently published because it will be used in related researches.

In this paper, we performed our experments in the three public datasets as follows:
(1)	MSR-Action3D dataset is an action dataset of depth sequences captured by a depth camera. The dataset can be found in http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/zliu/actionrecorsrc/.

(2)	UTKinect-Action3D Dataset was collected as part of research work on action recognition from depth sequences. The dataset can be found in http://cvrc.ece.utexas.edu/KinectDatasets/HOJ3D.html.


(3)	(3)G3D: dataset contained synchronised video, depth and skeleton data. The dataset can be found in  http://dipersec.king.ac.uk/G3D/
